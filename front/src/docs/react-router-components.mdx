# Using storybook with react-router-components

In order to ensure that react router components work with storybook, you will need to do the following:

##### 1.You will need to import memoryRouter from react-router-dom in the stories file of your component.

##### 2. You will need to wrap your component in the memoryRouter.

The code below shows an example:

```

export default {
component: Logo,
};

export const LogoComponent = () => {
return (
   <MemoryRouter>
      <Logo size={"sm"}></Logo>
    </MemoryRouter>
  );
};

```
