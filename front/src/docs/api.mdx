###How to use Postman with Wordpress API.

Before you can use Postman to edit or add data to Wordpress,  
you need to set up authentication.

To do that, select Auth (below the url) and enter these details:
Auth Type: Basic Auth  
user name: admin  
Password: KSyX V4Us cthi LkUo Ap4x ofrM

_Note: to save having to enter the authentication details for every new request,_  
_you could set it up at the collection level and then use 'inherit auth from parent' for each indivitual request_

### Some examples:

#### POST:

```
url:
    localhost:8000/wp-json/wp/v2/posts

body (raw text):
    {"title": "What happened to me", "Content": "this is the story about what happened to me yesterday", "date":"2024-12-10T13:11:20", "status": "publish"}
```

_Note: if you leave out ‘status: publish’ then the post is created as a draft post._

#### PUT:

```
url:
    localhost:8000/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/2
body (raw text):
    {"title": "What happened", "content":"this is the altered story"}

```
