### Using the useHover hook

This hook allows you to capture a mouse hover event without having to add the event handler to the element.

Add the following import statements:

`import { useRef } from "react";`  
`import useHover from "../../hooks/useHover.jsx";`

In your component, set the following variables:

`const elementRef = useRef();`  
`const hovered = useHover(elementRef);`

and add this ref attribute to your element:

`ref={elementRef}`

The `hovered` variable will now be true on `mouseover` and false on `mouseout`.
