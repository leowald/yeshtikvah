## Accessing categories with useContext

In order to avoid prop drilling (- passing props into many components in order to get it in the bottom conteiner), we use "useConext".
to pass down categories to any component, using categoryContext.jsx.

In order to access the categories in any component, follow these steps:

1.You will need to import useContex and categoryContext as follows:

```
import { useContext } from "react";
import categoryContext from "./store/categoryContext";

```

2.Now you can reach the categories object which has two properties: categories - which returns an array of categories pulled from db.json, and error - in the case of an error.
Note that you do not need to pass in any props
Use as follows:

```
  const { categories, error } = useContext(categoryContext);

```
