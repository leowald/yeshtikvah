# getBackground() function documentation.

This function takes in a background color or gradient. If it is a solid color (string), then it returns that color and the background changes accordingly.
If it's an object, it creates a string based on that object that will then set the gradient of the background accordingly.
Some parameters are optional, so in that case, it sets it to a default mode.
